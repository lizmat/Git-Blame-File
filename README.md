Git::Blame::File - Who did what and when on a file in a Git repository

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use Git::Blame::File;

my $blamer = Git::Blame::File.new("t/target");
say $blamer.lines[2];  # show line #3
# c64c97c3 (Elizabeth Mattijsen 2022-07-27 20:40:22 +0200 3) And this the third line
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

Git::Blame::File is a module that uses `git blame` to extract information from a single file in a Git repository. It processes the `git blame` information into `Git::Blame::Line` objects, while also keeping track of commits in `Git::Blame::Commit` objects.

Stringifies to the filename specified.

METHODS ON Git::Blame::File
===========================

new
---

```raku
my $blamer = Git::Blame::File.new: "t/target";
```

The `new` method either takes a single positional argument as the filename or the `IO::Path` object of which to obtain `git blame` information.

It can also be called with a `:file` named argument, and an optional `:commits` argument. The latter is intended for a future `Git::Blame::Repository` module that would potentially contain all `git blame` information of a repository.

lines
-----

Returns an `Array` with all the lines (as `Git::Blame::Line` objects) in the file. Note that these are 0-based, whereas line numbers are typically 1-based.

```raku
say $blamer.lines[2];  # show line #3
# c64c97c3 (Elizabeth Mattijsen 2022-07-27 20:40:22 +0200 3) And this the third line
```

commits
-------

Returns a `Map` of all the commits that were seen for this file (and potentially other files in the future. Keyed to the `sha1` of the commit, and having a `Git::Blame::Commit` object as a value.

file
----

The file from which the `git blame` information was obtained.
